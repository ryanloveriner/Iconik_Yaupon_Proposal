[This presentation](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/Iconik_Yaupon_Proposal/blob/main/New%20Product%20Proposal%20Protected.pdf) leverages market research and Iconik's historical sales data to demonstrate the high earning potential of launching a new yaupon based bar beverage in the Fall of 2025. It was presented to leadership, department heads, and supervisory Iconik staff to educate and emphasize company-wide profitability of novel product launches.

In brief, yaupon's local and sustainable sourcing options and invulnerability to tariffs make it a low-cost investment while its novelty, pleasant effects, and modifier-friendly nature position it well as a premium beverage experience, providing maximal margin opportunities. Iconik's historical sales show Fall/Winter to be an ideal rollout season. Contains estimated 2 week launch process upon approval.
